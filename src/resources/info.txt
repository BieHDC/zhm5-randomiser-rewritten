00204d1afd76ab13.REPO and fd76ef1b.REPO are from the Hitman 2 Game files.
The (awful) convertrepositorytocfile.py converts them to a Repository.c file,
which will then be used in the mod, eliminating runtime JSON parsing, while
also keeping modability and dynamicy.
If this needs to be updated, you can use quickbms and the hitmanrpkg.bms script
to extract all files from Runtime/chunk0.rpkg and its patch files.
I did it by starting to unpack chunk0.rpkg into a directory and then extracting
all of the patches on top of it in the same directory, overwriting existing files.
After thats done, head into chunk0/REPO/ and these are the json files the 
convertrepositorytocfile.py takes in. It checks for duplicates in those files too.
Maybe not the best and easiest way, but reliable. Just make sure you check if the
output is still correct, since the ghost mode removal for example messed with the
tags i used to identify such around.
